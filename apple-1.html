                <p class="col-md-6">The Apple 1 computer was created by Steve “Woz” Wozniak.  The first prototype of the computer was tested on June 29, 1975. Woz’s original design used the $175 Motorola 6800 CPU. When the engineers released the $25 MOS 6502 CPU, Woz changed some of his design to use the new chip. The Apple 1 computer had about 60 chips that were preinstalled. Back then computers were sold in parts and had to be put together. The Apple 1 was the first computer to be sold already together. The Apple 1 computer consisted of only a motherboard.  Woz offered to give his design to his employer, Hewlett Packard. HP turned him down all five times he tried. Games for the Apple 1 computer were sold on cassettes. A Star Trek game for the Apple 1 computer was sold for $5 in 1977. Steve Jobs was the only person who convinced Woz to try and sell the Apple 1 computer. Woz built all the Apple 1 computers by hand. Even though he built 200 units, he sold only 25. The wholesale price of the computer was $500, and the retail price was $666.66. According to Woz, “I was into repeating digits...Steve worked a deal to sell his computers wholesale price to the store for $500 bucks. What should the retail be. Add a third on. That puts it at 667 plus its 666.66 because it’s all one digit, to me that’s just an easier way to type. We didn’t know the number has religious significance.” </p>
