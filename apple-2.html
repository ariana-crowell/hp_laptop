                <p class="col-md-6">Steve “Woz” Wozniak created the Apple 2 computer in April of 1977.  Apple 2’s central unit was based off the same CPU that the final Apple 1 product used, MOS 6502 CPU. The design of the Apple 2 computer was inspired by Atari’s arcade video game Breakout. The computer started out with 4 KB of RAM and was eventually increased to 48 KB. Unlike the Apple 1, the Apple 2 was able to support color and graphics and came with a basic interpreter. The external storage was changed from the cassette tapes to an external floppy disc drive. Apple 2’s eight expansion slots on the motherboard were the most important feature. These slots allowed consumers to add cards from places such as Apple and a slew of other vendors who immediately sprung up. The boards include floppy disc controllers, SCSI cards, video cards, and CP/M or PASCAL emulator cards. The video controller put out a video that was suitable to display on a TV monitor or a conventional TV set through a separate RF modulator, with 40 columns by 24 lines of upper-case letters only, monochrome text on the screen.  This computer allowed the first computer spreadsheet to be released in 1979 by Software Arts. This “killer application”. This caused a huge number of Apple 2 computers to be bought. The Apple 2 computer was improved and upgraded several times over the years. Over 2 million Apple 2 computers were sold by the time the new Apple computer, the Macintosh, was released in 1984.</p>
