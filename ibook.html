                <p class="col-md-6">The iBook G3/300, also known as the clamshell was created by Steve Jobs. According to Jobs, the burden of filling that empty spot would fall to the iBook, a computer designed for consumers and educators, according to Jobs. These users had been asking for an “iMac to Go,” a computer with the ease of use and approachability found in the iMac G3. iBook features a 300 MHz PowerPC 750 (G3) processor, 32 MB or 64 MB of RAM, a 3.2 GB or 6.0 GB hard drive, and 2X AGP ATI Rage Mobility graphics with 4 MB of VRAM. The clamshell is packed into a sleek handle-equipped "blueberry" or "tangerine" case with a 12.1 inch TFT active matrix display, 800 by 600 pixel display. The iBook was introduced to the public as a low cost portable apple computer, similarly to the iMac models -- and likewise lacked Firewire ports, video out, and even a microphone. However, the iBook did herald the introduction of AGP-based graphics on the Mac as well as the innovative new optional "AirPort" wireless networking card. Later to become commonplace, "AirPort" made it possible to connect multiple iBook systems wirelessly to the Internet when paired with an airport base station (or other wireless system).There are two slightly different versions of the iBook G3/300 (Original/Clamshell). The original models introduced on July 21, 1999, shipped with 32 MB of RAM and 3.2 GB hard drives, and on February 21, 2000 -- to correspond with the introduction of the iBook Special Edition -- these models began shipping with 64 MB of RAM and 6.0 GB hard drives. The iBook, clamshell, was discontinued September 13, 2000.</p>
