                <p class="col-md-6">The iMac was first introduced at event on the 6th of May in 1998 by Apple’s co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, with Apple’s co-founder and CEO saying that it was designed for the number one use consumers tell them they want in a computer for, which is to be able to get on the internet, fast and simple. The iMac then went on sale for the first time on the 15th of August in 1998, 25 years ago, and became one of the most sold computers that Christmas. The iMac was known for saving Apple from being shut down, Steve Jobs also took some credit. Jonathan Ive, officially known as Sir Jonathan Ive, had designed the prototype for the iMac computer. Ive is from Chingford in North East London and has been knighted since he designed the iMac. Johnathan Ive still works for Apple. He is now the Chief Design Officer. The name iMac was dreamed up by Ken Segall who worked at Apple’s ad agency. Jobs wanted to call it MacMan, luckily Segall convinced him otherwise.</p>
