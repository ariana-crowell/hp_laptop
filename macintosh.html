                <p class="col-md-6">Jef Raskin created the macintosh computer in 1979. Raskin wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but it got changed for legal reasons. He wanted an easy-to-use and an affordable computer for everyday people. In September of 1979, Jef Raskin was authorized by management to start hiring to start the project. He started by looking for an engineer who could build the prototype. Bill Atkinson introduced Raskin to Burrel Smith. Bill Smith was a service technician who was hired earlier that year. Over the years, Raskin had built a large development team to design the Macintosh. By December of 1980 Smith had successfully designed a prototype that not only used the 68000 but also increased its speed; this board also had enough capacity to support a 384 by 256 pixel display. The Macintosh was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 24, 1984. The Macintosh 128k was announced to the press in October of 1983 and introduced in January of 1984. The Macintosh came with two applications that were designed to show off its interface, MacWrite and MacPaint. The Macintosh has been improved and updated multiple times. The Macintosh was the first personal computer to use a mouse and the graphical user interface. Apple exclusively produces the parts of the Mac, choosing internal systems, the design, the prices, and the operating system. The modern Mac is capable of using alternative operating systems. However, Apple does not license Mac OS X for use on non-Apple computers.</p>
